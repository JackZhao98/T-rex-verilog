	* top.v: More update

	* ClockDivider.v: Change parameter to 50M

	* top.v: Connecting modules in top modules.
	
	* DinoFSM.v: FSM module for T-Rex movement.

	* Gravity.v: v0.1 Initialze Gravity module. Initial speed and gravity are passed as parameters. Both variables are expected to be integers, and InitialSpeed is expected to be divided by 2 if squared (i.e. IS^2/2 is a whole number). 

	* draw*.v: All drawing modules are updated.
